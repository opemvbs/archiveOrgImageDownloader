# [NOT WORKING ANYMORE]

I've tried to fix the issues arised by @hamensman that keeps downloading the first page, but later while debugging I found out that it looks like archive.org has disabled the "downloading-by-link-iteration" method, so there's no fix, and there will be no more from me.


# archiveOrgImageDownloader

This is a modified and improved version of the [harrcor's](https://github.com/harrcorr/ArchiveOrgLibraryDownloader) repository.  
The script is most useful to be used on a protected book that needs to be borrowed, and that you can't download it by using the encrypted epub/pdf links. So, this script will download the image of the borrowed book one by one.  


## Requirements

- Operating system: Linux or Windows
I used Linux to modify this script, so in order to use Windows, you will need to change this one line from  
 ```driver = webdriver.Chrome("./chromedriver", options=chrome_options)```   
 to  
 ```driver = webdriver.Chrome("./chromedriver.exe", options=chrome_options)```
- Python 3.x  
- Git  


## Dependencies

This script depends on these few libraries:
- selenium
```pip3 install selenium```

- requests
```pip3 install requests```

- [Chrome WebDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
If you use Linux, then use the Linux version, same as Windows, use the Windows version.


## Usage
### Cloning the repository

You will need to clone the repostory by using the ```git clone``` command on Linux, or you can use GitHub Desktop application on Windows, or you can do whatever you want to clone it.

### Running the script
#### Linux

On Linux, open your terminal and change to your current working directory.  
Then, you will need to execute this command to run the script.  
```python3 scraper.py```  
Fill in the details in order to download your book.  

#### Windows

On Windows, open your command prompt and change to your current working directory.  
Then, you will need to execute this command to run the script.  
```python3 scraper.py```  
Fill in the details in order to download your book.  


### Example

```Your archive.org email account: foo@gmail.com```  
```Your archive.org password: bar123```  
```Your archive.org book link: https://archive.org/details/computationalmet00hann_0```  
```Your download directory/folder (relative to your current working directory): ./book/computationalmet00hann_0```  
```Your pages that will be downloaded: 488```  
```Your quality of images, from 0-10 (lower is better): 0```  

## TODO
- JPG to PDF converter and combiner into a single file.
- Make a GUI, if possible and have all the time in the world.
- Tweaks and stuff.
